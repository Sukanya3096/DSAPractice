<h2 style="color: 'brown'"> What is a Linked List?</h2>

<p> It is a data structure. It stores whatever sort of data you want, strings, numbers, it doesn't matter. And it's ordered.</p>
<p>It's a list of data, just like an array. But there's a really big distinction in an array.</p>
<p>Each item is mapped, it's indexed with a number so any time we add something in, it gets an index that is mapped to its position.
<p>A linked list, on the other hand, just consists of a bunch of elements with no indices who are just pointing to the next element.
Basically, Linked List is a data structure that contains a head, a tail and a length property. Linked Lists contains node and each node has a value and a pointer to another node or null</p>
